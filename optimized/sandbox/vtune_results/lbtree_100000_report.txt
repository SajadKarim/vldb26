    Memory Bound: 36.8% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 10.0% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
